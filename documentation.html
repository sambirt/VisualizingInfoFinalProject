    <h1>My design process</h1>
    <p> For my design process, I wanted to primarily answer the question "What is the relationship between video views and channel followers?". I was originally wanting to go for a bar graph to answer the question. However, translating it from paper to code proved to be pretty challenging. For a data set with a wide range of numbers and names, it would've been hard to fit it all in one graph. I also drew out the set of data on other types of graphs, and I found that a scatter plot works the best with the question I was wanting to answer. </p>
    <p>The scatter plot I made includes the number of followers on the X axis and the number of video views on the y axis. I also experimented with a function where if you hover over each dot, it displays a window that includes the number of followers, video views, and the name of the music video itself.</p>
    <p>I used my visualization to answer questions that I had by looking for any outliers, clusters, and predicting which music videos gained the most traction and which ones fell off.</p>
